# 20-dots-spinning
This is a project that I wanted to do since I saw a gif of the same thing on [r/oddlysatisfying](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/bz3yz7/circles_dots_and_lines_oc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). When I saw the gif, that contained just 20 dots (Here the Why of the name) i undesrstood how it worked:

* There are 20 dots, so the gif will last 20 seconds

* During these 20 seconds the farthest dot will do 20 turns, while the closest to the middle will do just one

* The dot on the middle does not move

The gif that is in the same repository was created by recording the code while working, it's not the gif I found on [r/oddlysatisfying](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/bz3yz7/circles_dots_and_lines_oc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). I found the autor of the original gif, and he/she did it in geogebra and recorded it with OBS. 
### __Make sure to take a look at the original [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/bz3yz7/circles_dots_and_lines_oc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)!__

The code was made and executed in [Processing](https://processing.org/), a Java based programming language.

The main code can be found in the sketch_20_dots.pde
